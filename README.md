ARRANGEMENT - SOURCE CODE - LATEST
======================

Introduction
----------

**By reading, downloading, using this source code (altered or not). You attest that you have read it's LICENSE and agreed with it. The original unaltered Half-Life SDK LICENSE and README are available in the files with the `VALVE_` prefix.**

This is the latest version of the source code of the Half-Life 1 total conversion: [ARRANGEMENT](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-1-arrangement).

If you consider creating a Half-Life 1 mod or total conversation using code/features from this source code. **We highly recommend that you use a clean Half-Life 1 source code base (Valve's 2.3 or GitHub's or Solokiller's fixed versions) and use this source code as reference**.

The main reason behind this recommendation is that you will find badly indented code, horrible C/C++ mistakes and many other horrible things (we were no C/C++ experts back in that time) so please don't use this as "base" and "don't blindly copy/paste" unless you want to face endless bugs, crashes as well as performance problems.

Usage
----------

If you deeply insist on building the source code despite our initial warning, you might be able to do so with Visual Studio 2013. It should be possible to build it on modern Visual Studio versions but it might require some fixes first.

It was also planned to support Linux but the port is fairly incomplete. That explains why the Makefiles are updated but the code "as is" likely won't compile.

To use your custom built binaries, you will **likely need the game assets and a Steam account with Half-Life 1 installed**, [this build should work but has not been tested with this version of the source code](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-1-arrangement/downloads/arrangement-2008-2013).

Maintenance
----------

**No support will be provided for this source code, Arrangement as a Half-Life 1 total conversion is [over](https://www.moddb.com/mods/half-life-1-arrangement/news/a-long-overdue-post-farewell-half-life).**
